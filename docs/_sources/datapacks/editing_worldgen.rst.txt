Adjusting Worldgen via Datapacks
********************************

Worldgen for Pokecube can be adjusted via datapacks. These datapacks should go in the standard minecraft location for datapacks, and are required before generating the world.

This mostly uses the vanilla format for structures, and you can adjust them via changing the values in the ``structure_set`` sections of the datapacks.

Sample Datapacks:
#################

- Removing all Structures: :download:`no_structures.zip`
    This datapack replaces the structure sets with empty ones, thereby preventing them from spawning.

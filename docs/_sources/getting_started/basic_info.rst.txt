Starting your journey
*********************

When you first create a world in |Pokecube|, you should spawn in or near a |Pokecube| village. In the village, there should be a pokecenter, and the professor should be in there to select your starter. If the professor is not present, you might need to wait until daytime.

In the case where you do not have a starting village, you can enable :ref:`guiOnLogin <pokecube-common.toml>`, and then reload the world, and you should get a prompt to select your starter.

.. _gene_machines:

*****************
Genetics Machines
*****************

These blocks allow for extensive genetic manipulation of |pokemobs|, as well as reviving fossils, and cloning of non-legendary |pokemobs|. These blocks are very dangerous, and should be used with great care.

.. warning:: Failure to properly use these devices can result in the complete loss of |pokemobs| and items!

These blocks require energy to run, this can be provided via the :ref:`siphon`.

.. _gene_extractor:

##############
Gene Extractor
##############

.. image:: ../_images/machines_items/gene_extractor.*

This block is used to extract DNA from various sources, including:

1.  Filled |pokecubes|
2.  Fossils - contain species genes
3.  Bottles of DNA

.. warning:: The Gene Extractor can delete |pokemobs| when used on a filled |pokecube|!

.. image:: ../_images/machines_items/gene_extractor_gui.*

To use the extractor, place the source of the DNA in the left most slot (source slot), and then a bottle of water in the bottle slot (top slot). Next place the required :ref:`selector <gene_selector>` in the book slot (bottom slot). The machine will then consume Forge Energy, and attempt to extract the selected DNA from the Source into the bottle.

.. warning:: Use with Legendary |pokemobs| is not advised, their DNA is volatile, and liable to be destroyed on extraction!

.. _cloner:

##############
Cloning Device
##############

.. image:: ../_images/machines_items/cloning_device.*

The Cloning Device allows reviving most sources of species DNA. In the case of Fossils, the DNA must first be :ref:`extracted <gene_extractor>`.

.. warning:: Placing a filled |pokecube| in the DNA slot of the cloner will destroy it when revived, and in the case of a legendary, it will revive wild, so you cannot re-capture it!

.. image:: ../_images/machines_items/cloner_gui.*

The Cloning Device gui has 3 main sections, the Egg/Material slot (Lower Left), the DNA Source slot (Upper Left), and the Other Items slots (Hexagon).

An Egg of some form is always required in the Egg/Material slot!

In the case of general DNA reviving, the DNA source goes in the DNA Source slot. For custom Recipes, such as :ref:`make_type_null`, the Other Items slots are used instead.

.. warning:: DO NOT place the egg in the DNA Source slot when using Other Items slots recipes, the egg's DNA will be spliced into the resulting mob, often resulting in un-wanted mutations and the loss of items!

This thing is cheaty and overpowered.


.. _gene_selector:

###################
Gene Selector Books
###################

The :ref:`gene_extractor` and :ref:`gene_splicer` require a selector to function.

Selectors have 3 main sets of properties:

1. List of genes to selector for
2. Chance for selector to be lost on use
3. Chance for DNA source to be lost on use

.. warning:: Default selectors have 90% chance of DNA source loss.

Making a Selector
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Selectors are made via vanilla written books. You can place each required gene on a separate line of the first page of the book, and then when the book is signed, it can be used as a DNA selector. Valid genes can be found in the :ref:`Genetics Guide <watch_wiki>` in the watch, or via the tooltip of a filled |pokecube| in the GUI of any of the :ref:`gene_machines`. To select all genes, you can just use ``all``, instead of a specific gene name.

Crafting a selector with a nether star will reduce the DNA loss chance to 0%, however will result in an increase in the selector loss chance.

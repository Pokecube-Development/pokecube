Legends and Quests
******************

**Introduction**
================
The |Pokecube| has bases that complement each other, Legends is one of those bases.
|Pokecube| Legends is the part that manages structures/dimensions and how legendary |pokemob| behave, both in spawn and capture.
On this page you will find information about the structures of the legends, their spawn forms, decorative blocks, exclusive blocks of legends and extra information. 

About dimensions, there is an exclusive page for it, you can see it by clicking here: :ref:`legend_dimensions`

**Exploration Structures**
==========================
In this expansion, several structures were added, and in this part we'll look at exploration structures.
Exploitation structures are buildings that do not have links with legendary |pokemob|, they can be explored by players to get items or special trades.

Raids!
~~~~~~
The Raids are here, and you can get strong |pokemob| and Gigantamax! Just find the Spots and start the battle!

**Raid Block**

**Raid Structure**

**Raid Dynamax Pokémob**

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/raid_pokemob.png
   :alt: raid_info

* Informações (Mechanics/Itens/Moves)

Defeated |pokemob| drop Raid's exclusive items, but if you catch them, those items will be in the |pokemob| inventory
Items are random, mixing |pokemob| Loot Table with Raid items.

Itens
~~~~~

**Wishing Piece:** is the item you use to activate Raid. But don't worry, Raids are reactivated after a while if you don't get this item.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/shard.png
   :alt: raid_info

**Gigant Shard:** is the item you use to get Gigantamax! To use it, choose a |pokemob| that has Gigantamax and click on it with the item in hand **!DO NOT PUT INTO THE INVENTORY!**,
if the item disappears from your hand it means that it worked, otherwise, check if the chosen |pokemob| has gigantamax. (Capturing |pokemob| in gigantamax form doesn't need to use the item!)

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/gigashard.png
   :alt: raid_info

**Mints:** This item can change your |pokemob| Nature, just use it in the same way as the Gigant Shard.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/adamantmint.png
   :alt: raid_info

**Z-Crystal:** are the items that grant the Z-Move.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/z_water.png
   :alt: raid_info

Catch |Pokemob| Raid
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To capture the |pokemob| of the raid we need two factors:

* 1º - The |pokemob| needs to be extremely low on health!
* 2º - You need to use Dynamax Cube to capture!

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/dynamax_ball.png
   :alt: raid_info

To create a Dynamax Cube you use: 

* You can use any Poke Cube to create the Dynamax Cube!

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/dynamax_ball_crafting.png
   :alt: raid_info

**Be aware that Dynamax Cube doesn't use the capture chance of the Poke Cube you use in the Recipe, so if you use a Master Cube for the recipe, it will work like a normal Poke Cube!**

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/dynamax_catch.png
   :alt: raid_info
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/dynamax_ball_convert.png
   :alt: raid_info

> Currently, after capture, the Dynamax Cube will become a common Poke Cube, in the future it will be modified to return the Poke Cube used in the recipe!

Use (Dynamax/Gigantamx/Z-Move)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Dyna/G-Moves:** To use the unique moves of these shapes, first you need to go to the Controls Menu and add a key in the |pokecube| area and then G/Z-Move.
Once this is done, you need to be in an area that allows you to use Dynamax. **Raids** allow by default the use of Dynamax, as well as the **gyms in village**.
But if you want to create a spot outside these places, just create the Max Spot block. 

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/max_dynamax_block_recipe.png
   :alt: max_spot

After everything is ready, just press the **-M-** button **(remember that you need to be equipped with a mega evolution item: hat, ring, etc)** and your |pokemob| becomes Dynamax.
While your |pokemob| is in this form, press the previously configured key and the Moves will be changed to Dynamax Moves.

**Z-Moves:** Z-Moves increase the strength of a specific move of your |pokemob|. To use it, you need to equip z-move in |pokemob| and it needs to have a move corresponding to z-crystal **(Z-Crystal Grass = Move Grass)**
With that in mind, just click the configured key and the move will become the Z-Move, but **ATTENTION!** the move can only be executed once, to execute it multiple times you need to collect your |pokemob| and throw it back into battle.
|Pokemob| exclusive Z-Crystals are integrated with base Z-Crytals, the difference is that the specific |pokemob| needs to have the specific Move to use the exclusive Z-Move.

**An example:**

* Pikachu with Thunderwave, if you use electric Z-move, it will use Gigavolt Havoc

* Pikachu with Thunderbolt, if you use the electric Z-move, it will use 10,000,000 Volt Thunderbolt

Team's Hideout
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The hideouts are structures based on the villain teams from the Pokémon games, in the mod you can find three secret bases: Rocket, Magma and Aqua.
The structures differ in their subterranean base, but have a similar top, which makes the structure more versatile when generated in the world.

The Bases only appear in the **Biome: Plain**

* Base Entrance:

   :alt: teams_hideout
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/team_rocket_top_2.png
   :alt: teams_hideout

* Team Rocket's base has a look reminiscent of the Red/Blue games; At the end of the structure, you can battle Giovanni.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/team_rocket_room_b.png

   :alt: teams_hideout
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/team_rocket_giovanni.png
   :alt: teams_hideout

* The Team Magma base looks similar to the Team Rocket base, but with alternate paths, you can battle Maxie.

* The Team Aqua base looks similar to the Team Rocket base, but with alternate paths, you can battle Archie.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/team_magma_boss_room.png
   :alt: teams_hideout

Elite Four
~~~~~~~~~~
Yes, there is an elite four. But in this case, it's much more complicated to beat her! The structure has four trainers, which are rotated when the structure is generated, so you will always have different trainers when you find the building. Trainers sell strong items, but they also have strong |pokemob|, so be warned!
The structure appears in all biomes, except Oceans and Beaches.

.. _aether_foundation:

Aether Foundation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The Aether Foundation has more than the function of an exploration structure, you can live in the structure, as it is considered a "Village",
you can battle and buy important items with Organization bosses.

The structure appears in Biome: Warm Ocean.

**Miscellaneous Blocks**
========================
In addition to the structures, the Legends expansion adds some extra blocks to the mod, some are just aesthetic and some have unique functions!

Totens Blocks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/totens_decoratives.png
   :alt: totens_decoratives
		
The Totem Blocks are decorative blocks themed by the Tapus of Alola |pokemob|.
Each totem has a special function, which can be activated by right-clicking and holding one of the list items:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/tapus_totems.png
    :alt: totem_items

[Diamond] - The list can be customized by Datapacks!

Each totem gives the player a temporary effect and can be used anywhere:

* Tapu Koko Totem [Speed Effect]

* Tapu Bulu Totem [Resistance Effect]

* Tapu Fini Totem [Health Boost Effect]

* Tapu Lele Totem [Glowing Effect]

Recipes:

    :alt: totem_color


Mirage Spot
~~~~~~~~~~~
Another curious block is the Mirage Spot, but you might know it as Hoopa Portal.
This block can spawn a random |pokemob| (except Legendary). You currently cannot get it in survival. But one way to get in touch with this block is to have a Hoopa. 

**If you have a Hoopa, it must have Move: Hyperspace Hole and have LV: 40 or higher**

**If your Hoopa meets the requirements you can generate a portal. Just use the move out of combat. The creation of the portal has a cooldown, so it cannot be spammed.**

**If the block is placed in the creative, that is, without being created by Hoopa, the portal creates an internal cooldown and is disabled until the time runs out and is reactivated**

**[Remembering that all these options are customized in mod settings or by Datapacks]**

    :alt: hoopa_portal

**Legendary Structures**
========================
While exploring the world you may find a few different structures, they are the 'Temples of Legendary'. Legendary temples need a key item and a unique quest completed so you can summon it and capture it. But for the most part not all have unique structures, some share the structure.

Treasure Maps
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
An alternative way to locate the legendary structures is to search for treasure maps!
They are located in this structure, similar to a ruin.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/treasure_map_legend.png
    :alt: treasure map

When you open the chest you will find maps with the location of the structures.

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/treasure_maps.png
    :alt: treasure map

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/treasure_map_looking.png
    :alt: treasure map

**Summoning Blocks**
====================
These blocks are used to summon the legendary. Use the correct key item and spawn the legendary.
Not all blocks have a recipe, those that have can be placed by the player, and those that are not created appear in the structures by the map.

The ones with recipe are:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/lengedary_blocks_recipes.png
    :alt: regis blocks view
	
**The core block of the Regis**

    :alt: Magearna Recipe

**Legendary Summoning Block**

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/legendary_block_recipe.png
    :alt: Legendary Recipe

and the blocks that do not have recipes are:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/lengedary_blocksno_recipe.png
    :alt: Legendy Blocks No Recipe

.. _make_type_null:

**Laboratory: Making Type Null**
================================

Type: Null is a |pokemob| created in the laboratory, so there's nothing more fair than creating it inside the |Pokecube| too :b

The first step is to find Aether Paradise, is the new structure that appears in the oceans:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/aether_foundation.png
    :alt: Aether_Paradise

In it, you will find some NPCs to battle, and reaching the top floor you will find the NPC Faba

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/faba_room.png
    :alt: Faba_Pokecube

Defeating him, you can open the trade menu, and there you will find Imprisonment Helmet, the main item to create Type: Null

**Now comes the part you need to pay attention to!**

You will need: Potion of Regeneration II, Imprisonment Helmet, Two |pokemob| eggs

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/typenull_recipe.png
    :alt: typenull_recipe

When items are in place, just power the :ref:`cloner` using an :ref:`siphon` and an electric |pokemob| (Higher levels make this go much faster).

**Making Golens of Regis**
==========================

In order to be able to summon the Regis you need to locate their temples. Each Regi has its own temple with a totem already built, if you play on a server or the temple doesn’t have the totem, you can build it (but this building must be inside the temple!)

**To create the Golem follow the images:**

For the base you will use the Golem Stone:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/golem_block_recipe.png
    :alt: Golem Base Block

And to the Top, you will use the Core Blocks:

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/golens_build_1.png
    :alt: Cores Golem Blocks

> You can use any type of Ice for the Ice Golem

To Activate, simply use the Key Item of your respective Golem

.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/dragocore.png
    :alt: Keys
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/thundercore.png
    :alt: Keys
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/icecore.png
    :alt: Keys
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/steelcore.png
    :alt: Keys
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/rockcore.png
    :alt: Keys
.. image:: ../_images/legends_wiki/items/regisorb.png
    :alt: Keys

> This is true for all blocks that use the key item: if it is out of the correct place of invocation or if it is the block you created and was placed in the wrong place, you will get this message when you try to use a key item in that block.
The correct location is just in the Golem temple area, if you want to remove this restriction, you need to create a Datapack by modifying the Spawn location.

    :alt: wrong location alert

**Secondary Spawn**
===================

Some |pokemob|, even though they appear naturally through biomes, can be summoned by items. These items cannot be acquired by Quest, only by purchasing with Merchants and Trainers after being defeated. Currently, not all Legendaries have a Secondary Spawn, but in the future everyone will have this option.

They are for the respective |pokemobs|:

# Documentation

To edit and test adding documentation, the following steps are required:

    1.  Install python3
    2.  Install pip for python3
    3.  Run `pip install -U sphinx` to install sphinx
    4.  Run `pip install sphinx_rtd_theme` to install the theme
    
Once you have done this, you can then build the page locally with `make html` in this directory. This will generate a directory called `html`, and in there, you can view the page by opening the `index.html` in a web browser.
